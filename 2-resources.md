## Course Texts
- Ormand, Kirk. *Controlling Desires: Sexuality in Ancient Greece and Rome*. Westport (Conn.) and London: Praeger, 2009.  
- Various supplemental articles and chapters in PDF or xerox form — see schedule.  

The cost of books should never be a deterrent to participation in a class that you want to take. If you have trouble affording our course textbook, please let me know, and I will work to get you an affordable copy through the resources of the College.
