### <a name="poem">Creative Project 1: Write a Poem.</a>

I will provide a small set of poems regarding gender or sexuality written by ancient Greek and Latin authors. Your goal in this creative project is to choose one author and **write a poem of 30-40 lines about gender or sexuality in their style, capturing their essence by using similar diction, poetic structure, and themes**. The poem’s meter is of your own choosing (even free verse!). The topic of the poem can be personal, drawn from your own life, or more generalized — you can create your own persona! The challenge of this creative project is that you are not allowed to tell me which author you are patterning your poem on — it should be self-evident from the words of your poem. Submit the poem with an original title (that doesn’t tell me which author or poem you are patterning your poem on) according to the submission guidelines above. A grade of satisfactory will be granted if I am able to tell from which poet/poem you drew your inspiration; poetic ability will not necessarily be a factor in the decision, unless it is clear that no effort was put into your poem.

### <a name="art">Creative Project 2: Artistic Rendering.</a>

**Illustrate a scene or object from any of the works we read this semester**, and **write a 5-6 sentence paragraph describing it**, as if it were on display in a museum and the paragraph is its blurb on the wall next to it. Any medium (electronic or physical: paint, pencil, sculpture, etc.) is acceptable. Some suggestions include ____________. I will be looking to see how (and how creatively) you render details of the text into a visual form, rather than evaluating how good of an artist you are. A grade of satisfactory will be granted if it’s clear what scene and what details from that textual account you decided to depict in your artistic rendering.

### <a name="eidolon">Creative Project 3: *Eidolon* Pitch.</a>

You’ll notice that the articles that I chose for your response essays are mostly drawn from the online Classics publication [*Eidolon*](https://eidolon.pub), whose mission is to publish articles by any level of Classics student or teacher (from high school to graduate-level) that explore topics in Classics in various ways: personal and emotional responses to ancient literature and art; the relationship of modern art, music, and literature to ancient Greek and Roman precedents; and so on.

The goal of this creative project is to **draft a pitch for an *Eidolon* article that deals with one of the themes of ancient gender and sexuality that we’re investigating this semester**. The topic can be as broad or as specific as you’d like.

The criteria for a grade of satisfactory are as follows:
1. You must have a witty title. Use existing *Eidolon* article titles as inspiration!
2. The content of the pitch must answer the following questions:
    1. What is the topic that you’d like to write about?
    2. What are at least two examples of primary or secondary sources that you would use in writing about it?
    3. Who is the intended audience for your *Eidolon* piece? The general public? Other college students? People who are knowledgeable about ancient gender and sexuality? People who know nothing about ancient gender and sexuality?
3. The pitch’s length should be about 2-3 pp. double spaced.  

<p class="list">Resources:</p>
- Check out *Eidolon*’s [instructions for pitching and their recommendations on what make a good pitch](https://eidolon.pub/how-to-pitch-especially-to-eidolon-7d925eec669).
- Make sure to read a few *Eidolon* articles first to get a sense of what topics an article can cover and how an author works with both primary and secondary evidence.

### <a name="oa">Creative Project 4: Selfie and Object Analysis.</a>

This creative project challenges you to **choose an object in the Greek or Roman rooms at the Worcester Art Museum and relate it to the themes of ancient gender and sexuality that we are discussing in the course**. You get free admission to the WAM with your Holy Cross ID. If you would like to complete an object analysis for an ancient Greek or Roman artifact from another museum (e.g., the Museum of Fine Art in Boston or the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York), that works too! Simply let me know that you’d like to visit one of those institutions, and I can help you locate an appropriate object.

The criteria for a grade of satisfactory are as follows:
1. Visit the WAM, and locate one of the following objects:
    - in the Greek room (up the stairs from the Worcester Hunt mosaic)
    - in the Roman room (in the back left room from the Worcester Hunt)
2. Take a selfie with your located object.
3. Answer the following questions:
    1. What is your object?
    2. When was it made? (Century of creation is fine if there is no more specific information available than that.)
    3. What material is it made out of?
    4. Where was it originally displayed?
    5. Which themes of ancient gender and sexuality does the object tie into? How?
4. The answers may be formatted either in paragraph/essay form or in bullet points — whatever format enables you to make your points most clearly yet concisely.
5. There is no page minimum or maximum, though a general guidelines of about 2-3pp. double spaced is good to aim for.
6. Submit the selfie and the essay to me via e-mail.

### <a name="pod">Creative Project 5: Podcast Lesson.</a>

The goal of this creative project is to **create a podcast in which you talk about a topic that relates to ancient Greek or Roman gender or sexuality**. The topic can be as specific (e.g., what is Aristophanes' speech in Plato's *Symposium* about?) or general (e.g., who were *cinaedi*?) as you want to make it. The challenge of this creative project is articulating important details about your topic with only audio: your voice, sound clips, music, etc.

The criteria for a grade of satisfactory are as follows:
<ol>
    <li>The content of the podcast must focus on explaining a topic that relates to ancient Greek or Roman gender or sexuality. Imagine an audience that knows nothing about but wants to learn about your chosen topic.</li>
    <li>The topic may be drawn from any topic discussed or mentioned in Ormand, in a secondary reading, or in class.</li>
    <li>In the podcast, you must write and use your own script — you cannot, e.g., simply read passages from Ormand aloud.</li>
    <li>If you quote or paraphrase a source, you must explicitly mention the name of the author or the source that you used in the podcast script.</li>
    <li>The podcast should be accompanied by a bibliography of sources, even if you use only Ormand.</li>
    <li>The length of the podcast must be between 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
    <li>The format of the podcast should be electronic, in an .mp3 or .aiff format.</li>
    <li>The podcast should be uploaded to an external site, like Soundcloud, and accessible via a public link.</li>
    <li>Submit the electronic file and public link to me via e-mail.</li>
</ol>

Resources and Tips:
<ul>
    <li>Make sure to contact me before you begin this project, as I have a list of resources that you can use to make the project easier, provided by Holly Hunt, supervisor of the Multimedia Resource Center in Stein 324.</li>
    <li>You can (and are encouraged to) use the <strong>Media Suites</strong> at the <strong>Multimedia Resource Center</strong> in Stein 324 to record your podcasts. Check out <a href="https://www.holycross.edu/multimedia-resource-center/media-suites-multimedia-resource-center" class="underline">this link</a> for information and for the portal to reserve a suite.</li>
    <li>If you want to go it alone, the best software to use to record the podcast would be <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" class="underline">Audacity</a>. It’s free and relatively intuitive to use! Guidelines on using Audacity to record a podcast can be found <a href="https://podcast.co/create/record-a-podcast" class="underline">here</a>.</li>
    <li>Make sure to use the podcasts assigned for the course as an inspiration for podcast style and content.</li>
</ul>

### <a name="vid">Creative Project 6: Video Lesson.</a>

This creative project prompts you to **choose a topic relating to ancient gender or sexuality to discuss on video**. Like the podcast (<a href="#pod" class="underline">Creative Project 5</a>), the topic may be as specific (e.g., what kind of musical instruments would Sappho perform on?) or broad (e.g., here are some examples of how women are depicted in Greek pottery) as you’d like. Unlike the podcast option, however, the challenge with a video lesson becomes using whatever visual media you can to get your point or your lesson across: pictures, gifs, videos, music, etc.

The criteria for a grade of satisfactory are as follows:
1. The content of the video must focus on explaining a topic that relates to ancient Greek or Roman gender or sexuality. Imagine an audience that knows nothing about but wants to learn about your chosen topic.
2. The topic may be drawn from any topic discussed or mentioned in Ormand, in a secondary reading, or in class.
3. For the video, you must write and use your own script — you cannot, e.g., simply read passages from Ormand aloud.
4. Any pictures, gifs, videos, or other media that you use in your video but that you did not create yourself must be properly sourced — a list of hyperlinks handed in separately would suffice.
5. You should include in the source list from #4 a bibliography of textual sources that you consulted, even if you use only Ormand.
6. The length of the video must be between 4 to 6 minutes.
7. The format of the video should be electronic (for example, in .mov or .wmv format).
8. The podcast should be uploaded to an external site, like Youtube, and accessible via a public link.
9. Submit the public link to me via e-mail.

Resources and Tips:
- You may use the **Media Suites** of the **Multimedia Resource Center** in **Stein 324** (see “Resources and Tips” for <a href="#pod" class="underline">Creative Project 5</a>) OR the **Production Studio** of **Digital Media Services** in **Stein 104**. They have great equipment and services, including a green screen, professional lighting, professional cameras, and post-production work like titles, overlays, etc. If you would like to use their services, you are **very strongly encouraged to consult with me early in the semester** so that we can collaborate with DMS on the project. If you leave it to the middle or (worse) end of the semester, there’s no guarantee that DMS will be able to help you with your project time- or space-wise.

### <a name="sappho">Creative Project 7: Complete the Fragments of Sappho.</a>

This creative project concerns the Archaic female poet Sappho, whose poetry remains for us only in fragments. I will provide a set of **four separate fragments**; your goal is to **fill in the lacunae based on the themes of Sappho’s more complete fragments**.

For example, if faced with a fragment like this (Sappho 29C):

<p style="padding-left: 100px;">] robes<br>] necklaces<br>]</p>

I might fill it out like this:

<span class="underline">She comes adorned in red</span>] robes<br>
<span class="underline">Which trail behind; her</span>] necklaces<br>
<span class="underline">Glitter like gold on her chest.</span>]

A grade of satisfactory will be granted for creative and grammatically-sound completions of the fragments.
