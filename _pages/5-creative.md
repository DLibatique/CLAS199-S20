## <a name="poem">Creative Project 1: Write a Poem.</a>

[Review this set of four poems by Roman authors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lh-eb5yhpwpA5N3SRVlNIO-1BsTUTQbj1SRpgCBjWNE/edit?usp=sharing). Your goal in this creative project is to choose one author and **write a poem of 30-40 lines in their style, capturing their essence by using similar diction, poetic structure, and themes; also, write a short (4-5 sentence) blurb on your process -- how did you go about capturing the author's essence?** The poem’s meter is of your own choosing (even free verse!). The topic of the poem can be personal, drawn from your own life, or more generalized — you can create your own persona! You may also choose a poem or a selection of verse from another work or author that we've considered throughout the semester, but I recommend that you run your choice by me first before attempting your own poem.

The criteria for a grade of satisfactory are as follows:
1. The poem must be 30-40 lines long.
2. Your blurb describing the process must be 4-5 sentences long.
3. Your poem must have a title.
4. Your poem must adequately capture your chosen poet's diction and style.
5. Submit the poem and blurb in one file via the [Upload Portal](https://forms.gle/AQSPjMyhwTN6x8Vw8).

The grading rubric for this creative project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pTxoNqLbyuZRWUzDxFG5i20nq7g8n0BxnMIt1juocNg/edit?usp=sharing).

## <a name="art">Creative Project 2: Artistic Rendering.</a>

**Illustrate a scene or object from any of the works we read this semester**, and **write a 4-5 sentence paragraph describing it**, as if it were on display in a museum and the paragraph is its blurb on the wall next to it. Any medium (electronic or physical: paint, pencil, sculpture, etc.) is acceptable. Some suggestions include Lucius’ transformation into the donkey in
Apuleius’ *The Golden Ass*, any of the metamorphoses in Ovid’s *Metamorphoses*, or one of Perpetua’s dreams from the *Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas*. I will be looking to see how (and how creatively) you render details of the text into a visual form, rather than evaluating how good of an artist you are.

The criteria for a grade of satisfactory are as follows:
1. The illustration must be of a scene assigned in readings for the course in the course schedule or textbook or from another reading approved beforehand by me. Contact me if you'd like to illustrate something that is not on the course schedule.
2. The illustration must have a title.
3. The paragraph describing your illustration must be 4-5 sentences long.
4. It must be clear what scene and what details from your chosen textual account you decided to depict in your artistic rendering.
5. Submit the illustration and paragraph to me via e-mail, or, in the case of physical media, submit both physically to me either in class or in my office (Fenwick 426).

The grading rubric for this creative project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LODxX6z4sJaSoSTDNeG6ja_8nfDyPSFjSOWPIeHdqhw/edit?usp=sharing).

## <a name="eidolon">Creative Project 3: *Eidolon* Pitch.</a>

You’ll notice that many of the articles that I chose for your response essays are  drawn from the online Classics publication [*Eidolon*](https://eidolon.pub), whose mission is to publish articles by any level of Classics student or teacher (from high school to graduate-level) that explore topics in Classics in various ways: personal and emotional responses to ancient literature and art; the relationship of modern art, music, and literature to ancient Greek and Roman precedents; and so on.

The goal of this creative project is to **draft a pitch for an *Eidolon* article that deals with one of the themes of Roman literature and society that we’re investigating this semester**. The topic can be as broad or as specific as you’d like.

The criteria for a grade of satisfactory are as follows:
1. You must have a witty title. Use existing *Eidolon* article titles as inspiration!
2. The content of the pitch must answer the following questions:
    1. What is the topic that you’d like to write about?
    2. What are at least two examples of primary or secondary sources that you would use in writing about it?
    3. Who is the intended audience for your *Eidolon* piece? The general public? Other college students? People who are knowledgeable about the Roman world? People who know nothing about the Roman world?
3. The pitch’s length should be about 2-3 pp. double spaced.
4. Submit the pitch via the [Upload Portal](https://forms.gle/AQSPjMyhwTN6x8Vw8).

The grading rubric for this creative project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YPi1lTB4i7ioyiJjM-wGjGx7cF42t6646b8M_A-f1No).

### Resources:
- Check out *Eidolon*’s [instructions for pitching and their recommendations on what make a good pitch](https://eidolon.pub/how-to-pitch-especially-to-eidolon-7d925eec669).
- Make sure to read a few *Eidolon* articles first to get a sense of what topics an article can cover and how an author works with both primary and secondary evidence.

## <a name="oa">Creative Project 4: Selfie and Object Analysis.</a>

This creative project challenges you to **choose an object in the Roman room at the Worcester Art Museum and relate it to the themes of Roman literature and society that we are discussing in the course**. You get free admission to the WAM with your Holy Cross ID. If you would like to complete an object analysis for an ancient Roman artifact from another museum (e.g., the Museum of Fine Art in Boston or the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York), that works too! Simply let me know that you’d like to visit one of those institutions, and I can help you locate an appropriate object.

Check out my Tweet thread on viable objects for analysis in the Roman room here:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve completed my semesterly trip to <a href="https://twitter.com/WorcesterArt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WorcesterArt</a> to scour some objects for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CLAS102?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CLAS102</a> this semester, and I found some great objects, all in the Roman room, ready for student analysis! (Project description, selfies, and titles in thread) <a href="https://t.co/aYlyHO5RfE">https://t.co/aYlyHO5RfE</a> 1/10 <a href="https://t.co/ATm0HxCz6R">pic.twitter.com/ATm0HxCz6R</a></p>&mdash; Daniel Libatique 🏳️‍🌈 (@DLibatique10) <a href="https://twitter.com/DLibatique10/status/1168659654643240970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The criteria for a grade of satisfactory are as follows:
1. Enter the WAM on Salisbury St. and come to face the magnificent Worcester Hunt mosaic; then, go to the Roman room, which is to the back left as you're facing the mosaic.
2. Choose an object in that room and take a selfie with it.
3. Answer the following questions:
    1. What is your object?
    2. When was it made? (Century of creation is fine if there is no more specific information available than that.)
    3. What material is it made out of?
    4. Where was it originally displayed?
    5. Which themes of Roman literature and society does the object tie into? How?
4. You can use the blurb next to / under each object to help you answer the first few questions. If you can't find an answer, that's fine -- just make sure to say so.
5. The answers may be formatted either in paragraph/essay form or in bullet points — whatever format enables you to make your points most clearly yet concisely.
6. There is no page minimum or maximum, though a general guideline of about 2-3pp. double spaced is good to aim for.
7. Include the selfie in your write-up, and submit the one file via the [Upload Portal](https://forms.gle/AQSPjMyhwTN6x8Vw8).

The grading rubric for this creative project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1w-QA29P8T42Go2qx9n59jdAIcaG4OnhreS3dSnQ46oQ).

## <a name="pod">Creative Project 5: Podcast Lesson.</a>

The goal of this creative project is to **create a podcast in which you talk about a topic that relates to Roman literature and society**. The topic can be as specific (e.g., who does Juvenal lambast in *Satires* 1?) or general (e.g., what is the *cursus honorum*?) as you want to make it. The challenge of this creative project is articulating important details about your topic with only audio: your voice, sound clips, music, etc.

The criteria for a grade of satisfactory are as follows:
1. The content of the podcast must focus on explaining a topic that relates to ancient Roman literature and society. Imagine an audience that knows nothing about but wants to learn about your chosen topic.
2. The topic may be drawn from any topic discussed or mentioned in your primary sources, in a secondary reading, or in class.
3. In the podcast, you must write and use your own script — you cannot, e.g., simply read passages written by our textbook editors or secondary source authors aloud.
4. If you quote or paraphrase a source, you must explicitly mention the name of the author or the source that you used in the podcast script.
5. The podcast should be accompanied by a bibliography of sources, even if you use only our textbook (Hackett).
6. The length of the podcast must be between 4 to 6 minutes.
7. The format of the podcast should be electronic, in an .mp3 or .aiff format.
8. The podcast should be uploaded to an external site, like Soundcloud, and accessible via a public link.
9. Submit the electronic file and public link to me via e-mail.

### Resources and Tips:
- Make sure to contact me before you begin this project, as I have a list of resources that you can use to make the project easier, provided by Holly Hunt, supervisor of the Multimedia Resource Center in Stein 324.
- You can (and are encouraged to) use the **Media Suites** at the **Multimedia Resource Center** in Stein 324 to record your podcasts. Check out [this link](https://www.holycross.edu/multimedia-resource-center/media-suites-multimedia-resource-center) for information and for the portal to reserve a suite.
- If you want to go it alone, the best software to use to record the podcast would be [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). It’s free and relatively intuitive to use! Guidelines on using Audacity to record a podcast can be found [here](https://podcast.co/create/record-a-podcast).
- Make sure to use the podcasts assigned for the course as an inspiration for podcast style and content.

## <a name="vid">Creative Project 6: Video Lesson.</a>

This creative project prompts you to **choose a topic relating to Roman literature and society to discuss on video**. Like the podcast ([Creative Project 5](#pod)), the topic may be as specific (e.g., what is the typical layout of a Roman epitaph?) or broad (e.g., here are some examples of how women are depicted in Roman love elegy) as you’d like. Unlike the podcast option, however, the challenge with a video lesson becomes using whatever **visual** media you can to get your point or your lesson across: pictures, gifs, videos, music, etc.

The criteria for a grade of satisfactory are as follows:
1. The content of the video must focus on explaining a topic that relates to ancient Roman literature and society. Imagine an audience that knows nothing about but wants to learn about your chosen topic.
2. The topic may be drawn from any topic discussed or mentioned in your primary sources, in a secondary reading, or in class.
3. For the video, you must write and use your own script — you cannot, e.g., simply read passages written by our textbook editors or secondary source authors aloud.
4. Any pictures, gifs, videos, or other media that you use in your video but that you did not create yourself must be properly sourced — a list of hyperlinks handed in separately would suffice.
5. You should include in the source list from #4 a bibliography of textual sources that you consulted, even if you use only our textbook (Hackett).
6. The length of the video must be between 4 to 6 minutes.
7. The format of the video should be electronic (for example, in .mov or .wmv format).
8. The video should be uploaded to an external site, like Youtube, and accessible via a public link.
9. Submit the public link to me via e-mail.

### Resources and Tips:
- You may use the **Media Suites** of the **Multimedia Resource Center** in **Stein 324** (see “Resources and Tips” for [Creative Project 5](#pod)) OR the **Production Studio** of **Digital Media Services** in **Stein 104**. They have great equipment and services, including a green screen, professional lighting, professional cameras, and post-production work like titles, overlays, etc. If you would like to use their services, you are **very strongly encouraged to consult with me early in the semester** so that we can collaborate with DMS on the project. If you leave it to the middle or (worse) end of the semester, there’s no guarantee that DMS will be able to help you with your project time- or space-wise.

## <a name="spotify">Creative Project 7: Create a Spotify Playlist.</a>

This creative project asks you to use the medium of modern music to elucidate the themes that we're learning about this semester. **You are to choose an author, a literary work, or an event from ancient Roman literature and society and create a 4-6 song playlist of songs that capture the themes of that author, work, or event. Then, write a 2-sentence explanation for each song that expresses why you chose that song and how it relates to the author, work, or event.**

For example, if I chose the beginning of the *Aeneid*, in which Aeneas and his men are buffeted on the sea by a storm, I might begin my playlist with the song "Waves" by Mr. Probz, and then I would choose 3-5 more songs that capture the feeling or events of that opening scene of the *Aeneid*.

The criteria for a grade of satisfactory are as follows:
1. You must submit a document that clearly states the author, work, or event that you are basing a playlist on.
2. The document must include the title and artist of each song on your playlist.
3. Each title and artist must be accompanied by the 2-sentence (or so) explanation of why you chose that song and how it relates to the author, work, or event.
4. (If you don't already have a Spotify account, go to [Spotify.com](https://spotify.com) and sign up for one -- it's free!)
5. Create a playlist in Spotify and give it a witty title. In the description, include our course number (CLAS 102), name (Women and Men in Roman Literature and Society), and the author, work, or event that you're basing this playlist on.
6. Add your 4-6 songs to the playlist.
7. Get a link for the playlist by clicking on the circle with three dots next to the big green "Play" button towards the top of the playlist window > hovering over "Share" > clicking on "Copy Playlist Link."
8. Paste the link into your document.
9. Submit the file via the [Upload Portal](https://forms.gle/AQSPjMyhwTN6x8Vw8).

## <a name="tweet">Creative Project 8: Livetweet a Reading.</a>

This creative project challenges you to concisely summarize and react to any of the readings in the [Response Readings and Podcasts list] via a livetweet thread on Twitter. Twitter's 280-character tweet limits and threading capabilities allow you to react to a reading, podcast, etc., in real time while exercising your capacities for brevity and comprehension.

Please note that the article, chapter, or podcast that you livetweet must NOT be one that you wrote or will write a response to. Double dipping will result in an automatic grade of unsatisfactory for whichever is submitted second.

Check out an example of a livetweet reaction to a reading from Dr. Amy Pistone of Gonzaga University:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Reading &quot;Criteria of Negro Art&quot; by W.E.B. Du Bois instead of writing.  Thread to record my fave bits, possibly for later use or also just because this work is wonderful and y&#39;all should read the whole thing (it&#39;s not long) or else just these highlights! 👇<a href="https://t.co/U9Vz1o29wT">https://t.co/U9Vz1o29wT</a></p>&mdash; Amy Pistone (@apistone) <a href="https://twitter.com/apistone/status/1024761042872807425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The criteria for a grade of satisfactory are as follows:
1. The livetweet thread must offer the most important arguments or points of one of the assignments listed on the course schedule (any reading or podcast).
    - It may also include your reactions to those arguments or points and how they relate to your understanding of gender and sexuality.
2. Your first tweet must include:
    - the bibliographic entry for the source that you are livetweeting (copy and paste from the course schedule)
    - the hashtag #CLAS102
3. Your livetweets must be threaded together. For instructions on how to thread properly, click [here](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/create-a-thread).
4. Your livetweet thread must be 8-12 tweets long.
5. You must include at least two important quotes from the reading or podcast in your tweet thread.
    - These two quotes cannot take up more than 2 of your 8-12 tweets.
6. Post the Twitter thread, get a link for the first tweet of the thread, and then e-mail me the link.

The grading rubric for this creative project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_TLwO37dbwyhsVLWgNL6oiKX1B9a4vkrDkT2cRg702Q).
